This file can be used to load plugins that have been defined in other
packages. Simply rename `plugin_loader.go.in` to `plugin_loader.go`,
import the packages that define the plugins, and change the
`LoadExternalPlugins` method so your plugins are added to `AvailablePlugins`
correctly.

Commented out below you'll find some example code that demonstrates how we use
this in capability within Mozilla Services.
